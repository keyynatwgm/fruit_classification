# Fruit Classification using EfficientNetB1 üçé

This repository contains the code and resources for a fruit classification project using the **EfficientNetB1** deep learning model. The goal of this project is to classify different types of fruits based on image data with high accuracy while maintaining an efficient computational performance.

## [1] Overview

In this project, we implement a fruit classification model using **EfficientNetB1**, a powerful and efficient convolutional neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of various fruit images and is capable of distinguishing between multiple fruit types with high accuracy.

## [2] Dataset

This dataset contains images of whole fruit and pieces of fruit consisting of 44 fruit classes, such as:
* üçé Apple (Apel)
* ü•ë Avocado (Alpukat)
* üçå Banana (Pisang)
* üçí Cherries (Ceri)
* ü•• Coconut (Kelapa)
* üçá Grape (Anggur)
* üçã Lemon (Lemon)
* ü•≠ Mangga (Mangga)
* üçâ Watermelon (Semangka) etc.

## [3] Model Architecture

EfficientNetB1 is part of the EfficientNet family of models, which are known for their balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The model scales up neural networks in a more structured way by uniformly scaling network width, depth, and resolution, leading to better performance with fewer resources.

## [4] Why EfficientNetB1?

We chose EfficientNetB1 for this project for the following reasons:
1. Efficiency: EfficientNetB1 offers a great trade-off between model size and accuracy. It is designed to achieve better accuracy with fewer parameters compared to traditional models like ResNet or VGG.
2. Scalability: EfficientNetB1 is part of a scalable architecture that allows us to easily adapt the model to different computational constraints. For fruit classification, EfficientNetB1 provides a suitable balance between speed and performance.
3. Accuracy: With its optimized architecture, EfficientNetB1 is capable of delivering high classification accuracy on image data, making it ideal for tasks like fruit classification where precise predictions are needed.
